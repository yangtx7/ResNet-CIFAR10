# ResNet-CIFAR10

I'm playing with ResNet on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Just a joke, it is the small project of "Artificial Neural Network" course in SYSU, in the Spring 2023 Semester.

I have achieved a correct rate of 96.55% on the CIFAR10 test set, and the default hyperparameter in the code is just fit for getting the result!
